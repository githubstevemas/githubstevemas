# Hi there :wave:

I'm Steve, welcome you to my GitHub profile. Here, you'll find my projects, contributions, and everything I'm passionate about in the world of tech and development.

## About Me :man_technologist:
After spending over 15 years as a manager in the retail industry, I've decided to pivot my career towards my true passion: technology and computer science. This professional shift has led me to embark on a journey to become a developer. Currently, I'm immersed in a comprehensive Python training program, honing my skills and expanding my knowledge.

## Projects :wrench:
During my training, I worked on various projects. Here's a look at a few of them:

- [CRM Event Manager](https://github.com/githubstevemas/CRM-Event-Manager) : Application designed to efficiently manage clients, events, and employees, with key features like secure user authentication, role-based access control, and full CRUD operations. It leverages SQLAlchemy for database interactions, JWT for authentication, and pytest for robust unit testing.
- [SoftDesk Support](https://github.com/githubstevemas/SoftDesk-Support) : A Django-based API designed to help businesses efficiently manage and track technical issues. It emphasizes security with JWT for authentication, ensures GDPR-compliant data protection, and incorporates energy-efficient coding practices. The application is built using Django REST Framework and SQLite for development.
- [Orange County Lettings](https://github.com/githubstevemas/Orange-County-Lettings) Django-based web application designed for property lettings. It integrates with AWS for secure storage and deployment, the project also emphasizes data integrity and scalability, making it ideal for large-scale property management systems. Containerized with Docker, it's easily deployable and comes with comprehensive documentation using Sphinx.
- [PyScraper](https://github.com/githubstevemas/PyScraper) : Python tool utilizing Beautiful Soup to automate data extraction and image scraping, efficiently handling pagination and dynamic content, with outputs in configurable CSV formats.
